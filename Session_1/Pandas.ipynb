         "Moët & Chandon's new prestige cuvée is a remarkable blend of three different styles of wine: young and fresh, wood aged and bottle aged. The oldest wine in this blend dates from 1993. It's superb—more wine than bubbles—with a patina of maturity that is also so fresh. Toast and crisp apples make a wonderful pair of flavors. It is complex, ripe and unforgettable."

Common examples include `.mean()`, `.median()`, `.min()`, `.max()`, and `.sum()` for numerical data, as well as `.value_counts()` for categorical data. These functions can be applied to entire DataFrames or specific columns, giving us insights such as average values, distributions, and totals.
